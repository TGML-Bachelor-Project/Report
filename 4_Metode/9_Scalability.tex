\subsection{Scalability}
\label{sec:Method:Scalability}
A key focus of this project was to make the modelling approach scalable, in order to enable the modelling of larger, more realistic networks.
This subsection describes how vectorization of the model's calculations is introduced in order to parallelize the computations, enabling sufficient use of CUDA.
