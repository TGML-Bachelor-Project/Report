\subsection{First Research Question}
\label{sec:ResearchQuestion1}
The first research question of this project states:
\\
"How  well  can  dynamic  networks  be  modelled  using  a  SCVM  representation  in latent Euclidean space, with stepwise event computation?"
\\\\
In order to answer this question, the modelling approach will be evaluated on synthetically generated data.
Here synthetic dataset 1 is utilized, which is synthesized using a single velocity vector, as explained in section \ref{sec:Data:SyntheticData:SyntheticDataset1}.

\subsubsection{Modelling of single-step synthetic data}
\label{sec:ResearchQuestion1:singleStepSynthetic}
The first part of answering research question one consists of confirming proper modelling performance of a single-step Constant Velocity Model(CVM). 
This is done as an initial procedure as it lays the foundation of the stepwise CVM, meaning if the single-step model does not work as intended, the stepwise will neither.
\\\\
\textbf{Loss and beta convergence results.}
The stepwise model has been trained for 50, 500 and 5000 epochs on the full dataset 1 as one training batch using a single velocity step and a learning rate of 0.025. The model is compared against a baseline model which is simply a model with no dynamics i.e. a model with no velocities. Also for comparison the ground truth is provided.
Below, table \ref{tab:SingleStep1}, shows the learned beta parameter and final negative log loss, including that of the ground truth model.

The baseline that has no dynamics is killed here, as it is not even able to be intepreted for intensity rate comparison.




\subsubsection{Multi-step TDGN modelling of synthetic data}
\label{sec:ResearchQuestion1:multiStepSynthetic}
The second part of answering the first research question evaluates the SCVM with 10 steps to test its capabilities with multiple steps.
The test uses the synthetic dataset 2, see section \ref{sec:Data:SyntheticData:SyntheticDataset2}.
