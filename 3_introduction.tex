\subsubsection{Research Questions} 
\label{sec:Intro:ResearchQs}
To guide the investigation a set of research questions have been formulated.
\\\\
\textbf{Main Research Question}
\\
How can a scalable and explainable model be implemented for visualizing interactions in a temporal dynamic graph network?
\\\\
\textbf{Sub-Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How well can TDGNs be modelled using a velocity-dependant representation in latent Euclidean space, with stepwise event computation, and how well can it model the evolution of the TDGNs?
    
   \item To what extend can the model be implemented in a scalable manner?
   
   \item How can the model be visualized to enforce explainability?
   
\end{itemize}
