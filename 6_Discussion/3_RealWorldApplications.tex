The proposed SCVM represents the possibility of modelling larger dynamical networks in latent space using Newtonian dynamics.
While not many dynamic networks are based in Newtonian dynamic, the stepwise approach enables for the modelling of non-Newtonian dynamic networks with greater detail than previous work, while retaining the ease of explainability that Newtonian dynamics in latent space provides.

In this regard, the SCVM
