\subsection{Future Work and Improvements}
\label{sec:Discussion:FutureWork}
A stated in previous sections, the work of this project takes a big step towards utilizing the latent space modelling approach as a detailed, scalable means of modelling temporally dynamic graph networks data in an explainable way.
\\\\
In order to fully realize the potential of this technology, some further improvements could advantageously be implemented.



First of all, the while the scalability has
