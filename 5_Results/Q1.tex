\subsection{First Research Question}
\label{sec:ResearchQuestion1}
The first research question of this project states:
\\
"How well can TDGNs be modelled using a velocity-dependant representation in latent Euclidean space, with stepwise event computation, and how well can it model the evolution of the TDGNs?"
\\\\
In order to answer this question, the modelling approach will be evaluated on synthetically generated data.


\subsubsection{Single-step TDGN modelling of synthetic data}
\label{sec:ResearchQuestion1:singleStepSynthetic}
The first part of answering the first research question consists in confirming proper modelling performance of a single-step Constant Velocity Model. 
This is done as it lays the foundation of the stepwise CVM, meaning if the single-step model does not work as intended, the stepwise will neither.

Synthetic dataset 1, see section \ref{sec:Method:Reproducibility:SyntheticDataset1}, is utilized here.
